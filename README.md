# Focus Time

Like the name, this phone app will help users maximise the time designated to achieve a task and keep track of accomplished task. It's built based on the `Pomodoro technique`. According to Wikepedia,

_"the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks"_

This app provides just that, a `kitchen timer` in your phone and in addition, a way to keep track of completed task.

I hope you enjoy using it.
